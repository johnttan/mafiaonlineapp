# Post Project Review

---



###Improvements to be made
* **Socket.IO authentication**

    The app lacked authentication and the ability to persist users.

* **Testing**

    There were no tests for any of the code. This made it difficult and time-consuming to test features and fix issues. Tests should have been written alongside the business logic.

* **Entanglement**

    There were lazy hacks that bound pieces of code together with glue. Some parts became difficult to change without breaking functionality.

* **Documentation**

    No documentation on class signatures, functions, and the code itself. It would have been best to document as code was written.

* **Lackluster UI**

    UI lacks functionality and color. Does not help user understand how to use it. Many improvements to be made. Highlighting of chat messages, notifications, configuration of UI, responsive clicks. In future projects, I hope to utilize material design principles to bring out a more lifelike application.
