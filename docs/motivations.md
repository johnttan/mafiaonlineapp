# Motivations
I was intrigued by the idea of online implementations of social deduction games. Does the social aspect translate well? Is there strategy to it?

To answer these questions, I researched EpicMafia.com (an existing online implementation), and found that the game retains a surprising amount of depth and complexity. EpicMafia expands on the game by offering a diverse array of roles and deeper game mechanics such as reporting and multi-role interactions.

This project was also an opportunity for me to learn Socket.io and larger scale OOP.
